            <img src="./assets/images/cat-3.jpg" alt="Cute Cat 3" />
            
            <p>The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Because of its retractable claws, it is adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It also secretes and perceives pheromones. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">Read the full article</a></p>

            <p>
              Nearly all cats, including lions, tigers and the domestic cat, are
              descended from one prehistoric creature. The oldest known
              relative, the African Wildcat, first developed over 12 millions
              years ago. The species still exists, living in the Savannah in the
              Middle East and Africa. Cats began to choose to live with people
              in 4000 BC, in Ancient Egypt. They began to search towns for food,
              usually rats in Egyptian grain stores, and the relationship
              between cats and humans began. The Ancient Egyptians welcomed cats
              into their home, usually to keep snakes away. They began to
              worship cats as sacred animals, banning them from being taken to
              other countries.

              <p>
                  Feeding your cat is an essential part of their care. It's important to provide a well-balanced diet
                  that meets their nutritional needs. Choose high-quality cat food and follow the recommended feeding
                  guidelines. Additionally, make sure your cat has access to fresh water at all times.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Cats are obligate carnivores, so their diet should include a good amount of animal protein.
                  Consult with your veterinarian to determine the best diet for your cat based on factors like age,
                  weight, and health conditions.
