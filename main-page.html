            <img src="./assets/images/cat-3.jpg" alt="Cute Cat 3" />

            <p>
              The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or
              house cat, is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae.
              Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the
              domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC.
              It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges
              freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by
              humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Because
              of its retractable claws, it is adapted to killing small prey like
              mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes,
              sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well
              developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a
              crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations
              like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting
              as well as cat body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too
              high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small
              mammals. It also secretes and perceives pheromones.

              As of 2023, The International Cat Association (TICA) recognizes 73

            <p>
              Nearly all cats, including lions, tigers and the domestic cat, are
              descended from one prehistoric creature. The oldest known
              relative, the African Wildcat, first developed over 12 millions
              years ago. The species still exists, living in the Savannah in the
              Middle East and Africa. Cats began to choose to live with people
              in 4000 BC, in Ancient Egypt. They began to search towns for food,
              usually rats in Egyptian grain stores, and the relationship
              between cats and humans began. The Ancient Egyptians welcomed cats
              into their home, usually to keep snakes away. They began to
              worship cats as sacred animals, banning them from being taken to
              other countries.

            Feeding your cat is an essential part of their care. It's important
            to provide a well-balanced diet that meets their nutritional needs.
            Choose high-quality cat food and follow the recommended feeding
            guidelines. Additionally, make sure your cat has access to fresh
            water at all times.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cats are obligate carnivores, so their diet should include a good
            amount of animal protein. Consult with your veterinarian to
            determine the best diet for your cat based on factors like age,
            weight, and health conditions.

            </li>
            <li>

      <h2>Cat Health Care</h2>
      <p>
        Being a responsible cat owner means looking after their health and
        welfare at all times. The best thing you can do is to make sure they
        have a calm, relaxed life, but there are a few other things to remember
        as well. Here are our tips for keeping your cat healthy and happy.
      </p>
      <h3>Regular grooming and health checks</h3>
      <p>
        Cats enjoy regular grooming, which keeps their coat in good condition.
        Grooming your cat each day is a great way to notice changes in their
        health. Remember:
      </p>
      <ul class="health-care-ul">
        <li>
          Spot health problems early by checking for signs of injury or illness
          - and don't forget, cats have a similar pain threshold to people.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep an eye out for behaviour changes - stressed or insecure cats can
          become unwell, and changes to their behaviour can be an early sign
          that something's wrong.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changes may not always be obvious, as cats can have different ways of
          showing that they're upset or in pain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get it checked - if you notice anything unusual, including changes in
          behaviour or grooming habits, take your cat to the vet as soon as
          possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Only use medicine your vet has prescribed - human and dog medicines
          can be very dangerous to cats.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Get your cat neutered</h3>
      <p>
        To prevent unexpected kittens, it's also a good idea to get your cat
        spayed or neutered. This simple operation is carried out by a vet, and
        for female cats, it should be done before they reach four months. For
        male cats, neutering (or 'the snip') will stop them from fighting with
        other cats, so they're less likely to be injured or catch diseases. It
        can also stop them from spraying in the house.
      </p>
      <h3>Take out pet insurance</h3>
      <p>
        Vet bills can be expensive, so it's a good idea to take out pet
        insurance to save you from any nasty surprises. Pet health care packages
        can help you manage vet costs too. Many vets provide these, including
        Medivet, CVS UK Ltd veterinary group practices and Companion
        Care/Vets4Pets. Find your local vet to discuss their healthcare scheme.
      </p>
      <h3>Know your cat's breed</h3>
      <p>
        Finally, different cat breeds are prone to their own health and
        behaviour problems, so reading up on your cat's breed will tell you what
        to look out for. Some breeds have exaggerated physical features that can
        reduce their quality of life, while others are prone to inherited
        disorders or diseases. As always, ask your vet for advice if you're not
        sure about anything.
